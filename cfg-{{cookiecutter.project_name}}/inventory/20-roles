# NOTE: If netbox is not used, nothing needs to be changed here. In
#       this case this inventory is used as before. The hosts are
#       then managed here as normal.
#
#       If netbox is used this file is only used to store the hosts
#       for the initial import into the netbox.
#
#       After the initial import of the inventory in the netbox,
#       the groups in this file can be emptied. The systems are
#       then assigned to their roles via tags in the netbox.
